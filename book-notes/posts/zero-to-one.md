# Zero to One

Notes on startups, or how to build the future.

## Core Concept

Going from 0 to 1 (creating something new) is harder than going from 1 to n (copying).

## Key Ideas

### Monopoly vs Competition
- Competition destroys profits
- Aim to build a monopoly through differentiation

### The Power Law
- A small number of companies vastly outperform all others
- Focus on finding and backing those outliers

### Secrets
- Great companies are built on secrets others don't see
- Ask: "What valuable company is nobody building?"

## Favorite Quote

> "The best startups might be considered slightly less extreme kinds of cults."

## My Takeaways

Think contrarian. The best opportunities are hidden in plain sight.
