# Meditations

Personal writings of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

## Core Themes

### Impermanence
Everything is temporary. Accept change as natural.

### Control
Focus only on what you can control: your thoughts

 and actions.

### Present Moment
The present is all we have. Past is gone, future is uncertain.

## Key Quotes

> "You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

> "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."

> "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."

## My Takeaways

Stoicism is practical philosophy. Focus on what you control, accept what you cannot.
