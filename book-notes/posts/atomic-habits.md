# Atomic Habits

A practical guide to building good habits and breaking bad ones.

## Core Idea

Small habits compound over time. 1% better every day = 37x better in a year.

## The Four Laws

### 1. Make it Obvious
- Use implementation intentions: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"
- Habit stacking: "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]"

### 2. Make it Attractive
- Temptation bundling
- Join a culture where your desired behavior is normal

### 3. Make it Easy
- Reduce friction
- Two-Minute Rule: Scale down to 2 minutes

### 4. Make it Satisfying
- Immediate rewards
- Habit tracking

## Key Quotes

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

> "Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."

## My Takeaways

Focus on identity-based habits. Not "I want to read more" but "I am a reader."
